# 🌐 Daily Networking Projects – Basic to Advanced
🌐 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to design, subnet, configure, and test a network that connects the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments using Cisco Packet Tracer.
The network uses the base address 192.168.40.0 and splits it into two functional subnets, enabling smooth communication between both departments.

This project covers real CCNA-level networking skills including:
✔ Subnetting
✔ Router & Switch configuration
✔ IP Addressing
✔ Correct cabling
✔ End-to-End connectivity testing

🧩 Project Objectives

Create two separate departments: ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY

Each department must contain at least 2 PCs

Use appropriate switches and a router

Configure all devices using the network 192.168.40.0

Assign correct IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway

Connect devices using straight-through cables

Verify communication using ping tests between both departments

🛠 Network Design Summary

Base Network: 192.168.40.0/24

Subnetting: Divided into two /25 networks

Accounts: 192.168.40.0/25

Delivery: 192.168.40.128/25

Router: Provides inter-department communication

Switches: One for each department

Connectivity: 100% success via ping

💻 Skills Demonstrated

🔹 Subnetting (/25 network creation)

🔹 Router interface configuration

🔹 Switch basic configuration

🔹 IP addressing and gateways

🔹 Cable selection & network building

🔹 Troubleshooting & verification (ping test)

✅ Connectivity Results

DELIVERY PC → ACCOUNTS PC → ✔ Success

ACCOUNTS PC → DELIVERY PC → ✔ Success

Router interfaces → ✔ Reachable

Network fully operational

🏁 Conclusion

This project successfully meets all the requirements by implementing a clear and structured network design. Both departments are fully interconnected through proper subnetting, routing, and device configuration. The project reflects essential CCNA networking principles and practical Packet Tracer skills.
